# Service Order Management

### About Project 📝

My first project in partnership with [Vitor Hiroshi](https://github.com/Vitor-Hiroshi) <br/>
We are developing a service order management program, programs that are heavily used in technical assistance or other customer service sectors. In this first phase of the project, the program connected to a fictitious company's database has the possibility of querying existing orders and registering new ones. New features will be released in the future.
